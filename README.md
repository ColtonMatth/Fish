## Introduction

Fishbook is an app designed for Android users in Minnesota to capture and record their fishing catches. It was our final group project for the Android Software Development course at Gustavus Adolphus College. Inspired by the popular Nintendo franchise, Pokémon, our goal was to create a platform for users to document their fishing experiences in Minnesota. Throughout the project, we followed Agile Development with three two-week iterations and held daily SCRUM meetings with our professors to refine our work. Our target audience includes fishing and ice-fishing enthusiasts who want to create a gallery of their catches. The app is designed to evoke the spirit of Pokémon's motto, "Gotta catch them all."
